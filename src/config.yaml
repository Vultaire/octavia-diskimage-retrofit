options:
  retrofit-series:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Ubuntu series (eg. 'bionic') to look for in Glance to use as base
      for the retrofitting process.
      .
      Default is to use most recent LTS. If no value is configured and the
      charm is not able to find the most recent LTS image in Glance it will
      attempt to find a image matching the series of the unit the charm is run
      on.
  retrofit-uca-pocket:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Name of Ubuntu Cloud Archive pocket to add to the image being
      retrofitted.
      .
      Default is 'ussuri' if ``retrofit-series`` is 'bionic', for other
      releases no UCA pocket will be added unless specified.
  amp-image-tag:
    type: string
    default: ''
    description: |
      When set the charm will add tag to any newly created images.
      .
      Note that the charm will allways add the ``octavia-diskimage-retrofit``
      tag to created images, this is for convenience and may be used by the
      charm for housekeeping in the future.
